# webpage

Open source webpage with express.js and node.js

## Installation

First you need to install node.  You can do it here => https://nodejs.org/en/download/ .  If don't know how to do it, just watch a youtube video.  When node.js installed you can type `node -v` to verify that it is installed.  Then you download the lates release.  You'll find it in the realease tab under the description for this repository.  Then you can download as a zip file or tar.gz file.  When you're done unzip the file.  If you want you can also use git to clone the repository.  If you want that just help yourself.  Then Type
`npm i`.  The command will downlaod the dependecies needed.  Finally you start the server with `npm start`.

Note that I recommend to change the `.env.example` file to `.env`.  The server will run without it, but you can use it to change the port the server lisens on for example.

## LICENSE

This repository is open source, however you have to read the `LICENSE` file to use it.  (It's just the normal MIT).  Note that the dependencies you install with npm can have different licenses.
